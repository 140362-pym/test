**Introduction**

In recent years, the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare has 
revolutionized medical diagnostics and predictive modeling. Among the myriad applications, 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, prompting intensive research 
into advanced computational methods for early detection and risk assessment. This paper explores the application of a 
logistic regression model trained via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in predicting the risk of heart disease based on a 
comprehensive set of physiological factors.


Cardiovascular diseases encompass a spectrum of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, 
with risk factors ranging from age and sex to blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Traditional 
risk assessment methods have often relied on linear models or heuristic scoring systems, which may 
overlook complex interactions and non-linear relationships present in the data. The integration of 
AI techniques such as machine learning offers a promising avenue to enhance the accuracy and granularity 
of predictive models, thereby improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

By leveraging large-scale datasets and sophisticated algorithms, AI enables the development of models 
capable of learning intricate patterns from diverse patient data. The use of logistic regression, a 
well-established statistical technique, in conjunction with SGD optimization not only facilitates robust
model training but also allows for interpretability of the underlying predictive factors. This approach 
not only aids in identifying individuals at higher risk of developing heart disease but also provides 
insights into the relative importance of various risk factors in disease prediction.

Furthermore, the scalability and adaptability of AI-driven models make them suitable for
integration into clinical practice, potentially transforming how healthcare professionals 
assess and manage cardiovascular risk. As AI continues to evolve, the synergy between computational
methodologies and medical expertise holds promise for more personalized, efficient, and proactive healthcare strategies.

In this context, this paper presents a detailed exploration of the logistic regression model's application 
in predicting heart disease risk, illustrating its potential to augment traditional diagnostic approaches 
and pave the way for future advancements in cardiovascular care.
