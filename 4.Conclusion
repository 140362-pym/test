Conclusion

In this study, we employed logistic regression, implemented through stochastic gradient descent, to 
analyze the predictors of heart disease based on a dataset of 100 patients. Through the analysis,
we identified significant factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and maximum 
heart rate that contribute to the likelihood of developing heart disease. The model demonstrated robust 
performance in predicting heart disease status, as evidenced by the evaluation metrics and the visualized confusion matrix.

Furthermore, we extended our analysis to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a new dataset of 
20 individuals, generated synthetically. By leveraging the trained model, we successfully predicted 
the presence of heart disease in these new cases and explored the influence of each feature on the prediction outcomes through scatter plots.

The findings underscore the importance of comprehensive risk factor assessment in cardiovascular 
health management. Our approach highlights the utility of logistic regression as a practical tool 
for understanding disease risk and informing personalized healthcare interventions. Future research 
could expand upon this work by incorporating additional data sources and refining predictive models
to enhance accuracy and applicability in clinical settings.

Overall, this study contributes valuable insights into the application of machine 
learning techniques for cardiovascular risk assessment and underscores the potential 
for personalized medicine in mitigating the burden of heart disease.
