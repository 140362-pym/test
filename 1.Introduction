Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, posing significant
challenges to public health systems. Its complex etiology involves a myriad of factors such as genetic predisposition, 
lifestyle choices, and environmental influences, which interact to influence disease onset and progression. Effective 
management and prevention strategies necessitate a comprehensive understanding of these factors and their interplay.

Logistic regression analysis has emerged as a valuable tool in biomedical research for exploring the relationships 
between risk factors and disease outcomes. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression is particularly suited 
for binary outcomes, making it ideal for predicting the probability of developing conditions like CVD based on 
a set of explanatory variables.

This study focuses on applying logistic regression to investigate the determinants of CVD among a cohort of 
100 patients diagnosed with the disease. By examining a range of biomedical, lifestyle, and health-related
data collected from these patients, the study aims to identify significant predictors of CVD incidence. 
Such predictors may include demographic factors, behavioral patterns, clinical biomarkers, and comorbidities, 
all of which contribute to understanding the disease's pathophysiology.

The objectives of this research are twofold: firstly, to delineate the roles of various risk factors in 
predisposing individuals to CVD; and secondly, to provide empirical evidence that informs targeted interventions
and personalized healthcare strategies aimed at reducing the burden of CVD.

The structure of this paper begins with an overview of the epidemiology of CVD, highlighting its global
impact and societal implications. This is followed by an explanation of logistic regression as a statistical 
method and its relevance to this study. Subsequently, the methodology section details the study design, data
collection procedures, and statistical analyses employed. The results section presents the findings of the logistic
regression models, emphasizing significant predictors and their implications. Finally, the discussion synthesizes 
the findings in the context of existing literature, addresses limitations, and proposes avenues for future research.

By elucidating the complex interplay of risk factors associated with CVD through logistic regression, this study
aims to contribute valuable insights that can guide healthcare policies and clinical practices in effectively combating
this pervasive public health challenge.
